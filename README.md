# KOMODIS dataset
This is the repository for the paper: "*A Corpus of Controlled Opinionated and Knowledgeable Movie Discussions for Training Neural Conversation Models*". 
We introduce an augmented dialogue dataset (**K**nowledgable and **O**pinionated **MO**vie **DIS**cussions) that is crowd-sourced and collected with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each dialogue is based on two feature structures (one for each crowd-worker) about the same movie:

### Dialogue examples
For detailed information please check the paper (link will be added soon!).

### Data
We provide the full postprocessed dialogue dataset in *data/dataset.json* (will be updloaded soon!).

For explanations on how to read and use the structured data, please check *data/example.json* (will be updloaded soon!).


### Model
We provide a baseline script to train a GPT-2 model with our dataset in PyTorch in *model/* (will be updloaded soon!).
